        h2 MAGIC 1
        p.
            The digits of all multiples of 9 add up to 9 or a multiple of 9. <br />
            If you keep adding them until you only have one digit, it will always be 9.
        p.
            9*9=81 &nbsp; (8+1=9)<br />
            9*137=1233 &nbsp; (1+2+3+3=9)<br />
            9*3641=32769 &nbsp; (3+2+7+6+9=27, then 2+7=9)

            Take any three digit number, invert it and subtract the smaller number to form the larger number. The tens digit will always be 9. <br />
            Look!!!! Is magic time!!!!
        p.
            542-245=297 (9 is the tens digit)<br />
            861-168=693 (9 is the tens digit)<br />
            954-459=495 (9 is the tens digit)
        
        p Do you know why? Let's do the subtraction in general!
        p.
            abc-cba (a&gt;c)<br />
            =100a+10b+c-100c-10b-a<br />
            =99(a-c) min possible value =1 and max possible value =8<br />
            99*1=99 (9 is the tens digit)<br />
            99*2=198 (9 is the tens digit)<br />
            99*3=297 (9 is the tens digit)<br />
            99*4=396 (9 is the tens digit)<br />
            99*5=495 (9 is the tens digit)<br />
            99*6=594 (9 is the tens digit)<br />
            99*7=693 (9 is the tens digit)<br />
            99*8=792 (9 is the tens digit)
        p Because all the possible values of 99(a-c) have 9 as the tens place, it can be always true.

            Another miracle, see what happens when you multiple two magical numbers 9 and 7 together.<br />
            7*9=63<br />
            77*99=7623<br />
            777*999=776223<br />
            7777*9999=77762223
